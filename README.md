=======


Cheetah is a distributed in-memory dual-active application engine. It attempts to replace backend database for certain application and provides fast responses for high-concurrency requirements.

Cheetah loads all data in memory with duplication mode, and is able to work well even a couple of non-contagious nodes are down.
